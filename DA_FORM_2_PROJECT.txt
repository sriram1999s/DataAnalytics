A market place is a intermediary link between a merchant(s) and a consumer(s). It takes away the hassle 
of visiting different websites or visiting different malls in order to compare the pricing of a product
that a consumer is interested in. So a market place, be it online or offline acts as a portal for all
merchants to exhibit and sell their products to interested customers. Customers would find it really easy
to make a sound decision on their purchases given the plethora of options in terms of pricing and features.
The merchants too could analyse and find out the products that seem to be really trendy and accordingly plan
their sales strategy and the investments that they would have to make in order to have a successful campaign
at the marketplace.
