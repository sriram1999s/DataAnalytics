Now that we have had our introduction, let us move on to discussing the actual analysis.

The notebook being shared is the same that we have included in our final report, let us take a look.

We begin, of course, by doing some initial cleaning. We judge the number of Null values in our data using plots and decide to remove them due to their small numbers.

After which we illustrate various plots that serve the purpose judging what the data looks like , to just having fun with it overall. * talk about a few plots and correlation matrix *

Standardize the data.

Now before building models , we wanted to process the data more and also only observe a subset of data during analysis . This subset would correspond to the data 
about a particular product since it makes more sense to do so. We accompolish this using a function that takes in the product name as a parameter and returns the processed subset.

Using this processed subset, we trained 4 models, SLR ,MLR , RF and ARIMA.

SLR was mainly used to judge correlation... makes sense.

We used R2_SCORE, MSE and MAE to evaluate the model performaces on test data.

Used RF to bring out importance of features (with and without)
F_regression

Chose the best model and conducted K fold (with and without)
